# NYC_Council_Capstone

For all the files inside this memory, we try our best to upload the original code with an HTML document. The HTML has a better view and most of them have a table of content so it is easy to navigate. The original code file includes code using R or Python. 

We have three main folders, data visualization, data cleaning, and final code.

*Data Visualization*

- heatmap for collision (It is a simple map for collision data in different years.)
- collision and injured and killed by year (included by inquiry 2 code in final code folders.)

*Data cleaning*
