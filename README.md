# NYC Council Capstone Project

For all the files inside this memory, we try our best to upload the original code with an HTML document. The HTML has a better view and most of them have a table of content so it is easy to navigate. The original code file includes code using R or Python. 

For the HTML file, you cannot directly read from here. You need to download it and open it in a web browser. Others could be read directly here. 

## Folder introduction

We have three main folders, **_data visualization, data cleaning, and final code_**.
All the links below are links to the HTML files, except part two for inquiry 5. That one does not have an HTML version. 

**Data Visualization**

- [heatmap for collision](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/data%20visualization/heatmap%20for%20collision.html) -It is a simple map for collision data in different years.
- [collision and injured and killed by year](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/data%20visualization/Collision%20and%20Injury%20and%20Killed%20by%20year.html) -included by inquiry 2 code in final code folders.

**Data cleaning**

- [speed limit](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/data%20cleaning/Speed-Limit.html) - this file shows how we join the latitude and longitude to the original data.
- [Joinning collision data with holiday and weather data](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/data%20cleaning/Joinning%20Collision%20Data%20with%20Holiday%20and%20Weather%20Data.html) - this file shows how to join the holiday and weather data into the previous dataset.
- [collision with holiday and weather](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/data%20cleaning/collision-with-holiday-and-weather.html) - this file shows part of data prep for the processed data before and also shows the data visualization of the number of kills and injured in different weather and day type.

**Final code**

For final code folders, it is named really organized. Some inquiries have only one file, but some inquiries have more than one. 

- inquiry 1: contains two files, [Inquiry 1_merge_collision_speedlimit_updated](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/Final%20Code/Inquiry%201_merge_collision_speedlimit_updated.html) is part one, and [Inquiry 1 Regression](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/Final%20Code/Inquiry%201%20Regression.html) is part two.
- inquiry 2: only have one file [Inquiry 2_final_code](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/Final%20Code/Inquiry%202_final_code.html)
- inquiry 3: contains two files, [Inquiry 3_part1](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/Final%20Code/Inquiry%203_part1.html) is part one, [Inquiry 3_codings of method2](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/Final%20Code/Inquiry%203_codings%20of%20method2.html) is part two.
- inquiry 4: only have one file [Inquiry 4](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/Final%20Code/Inquiry%204.html)
- inquiry 5: contains two files, [Inquiry 5_did_model_with_multi_variables](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/Final%20Code/Inquiry%205_did_model_with_multi_variables.html) is part one, [Inquiry 5_process_data_all](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/Final%20Code/Inquiry%205_process_data_all.py) is part two.
