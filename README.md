# NYC_Council_Capstone

For all the files inside this memory, we try our best to upload the original code with an HTML document. The HTML has a better view and most of them have a table of content so it is easy to navigate. The original code file includes code using R or Python. 

For the HTML file, you cannot directly read from here. You need to download it and open it in a web browser. Others could be read directly here. 

We have three main folders, **_data visualization, data cleaning, and final code_**.

**Data Visualization**
