For all the files inside this memory, we try our best to upload the original code with an HTML document. The HTML has a better view and most of them have a table of content so it is easy to navigate. The original code file includes code using R or Python. 

For the HTML file, you cannot directly read from here. You need to download it and open it in a web browser. Others could be read directly here. 

We have three main folders, **_data visualization, data cleaning, and final code_**.

**Data Visualization**

- [heatmap for collision] () -It is a simple map for collision data in different years.
- collision and injured and killed by year (included by inquiry 2 code in final code folders.)

**Data cleaning**
