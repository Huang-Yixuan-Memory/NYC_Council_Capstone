# NYC_Council_Capstone

For all the files inside this memory, we try our best to upload the original code with an HTML document. The HTML has a better view and most of them have a table of content so it is easy to navigate. The original code file includes code using R or Python. 

For the HTML file, you cannot directly read from here. You need to download it and open it in a web browser. Others could be read directly here. 

We have three main folders, **_data visualization, data cleaning, and final code_**.

**Data Visualization**

- [heatmap for collision](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/data%20visualization/heatmap%20for%20collision.html) -It is a simple map for collision data in different years.
- [collision and injured and killed by year](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/data%20visualization/Collision%20and%20Injury%20and%20Killed%20by%20year.html) -included by inquiry 2 code in final code folders.

**Data cleaning**

- [speed limit](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/data%20cleaning/Speed-Limit.html) - this file shows how we join the latitude and longitude to the original data.
- [Joinning collision data with holiday and weather data](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/data%20cleaning/Joinning%20Collision%20Data%20with%20Holiday%20and%20Weather%20Data.html) - this file shows how to join the holiday and weather data into the previous dataset.
- [collision with holiday and weather](https://github.com/Huang-Yixuan-Memory/NYC_Council_Capstone/blob/main/data%20cleaning/collision-with-holiday-and-weather.html) - this file shows part of data prep for the processed data before and also shows the data visualization of the number of kills and injured in different weather and day type.
